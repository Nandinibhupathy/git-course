High-Level Description of the Problem Being Solved

Operations users often face challenges in efficiently navigating and extracting actionable insights from exception dashboards, which can be cluttered with vast amounts of data. Manually filtering exceptions by date or type, identifying appropriate resolution resources, and determining escalation contacts is time-consuming and prone to errors. This impacts productivity and decision-making efficiency.

The chatbot addresses these challenges by acting as an intelligent assistant, simplifying interaction with the exception dashboard. It provides instant answers to user queries, enabling users to focus on resolving exceptions rather than sifting through data.

Summary of the Approach

1. Data Ingestion and Processing:

The exception dashboard data is imported into a pandas DataFrame.

The data is pre-processed to handle missing values, standardize formats, and ensure efficient querying.



2. Natural Language Query Processing:

User queries are parsed and interpreted to identify intent (e.g., filtering, resolving, or escalation).

Relevant parameters such as date, type, or exception ID are extracted.



3. Function Execution:

Based on the intent, the appropriate function is invoked to process the DataFrame and return the required results.



4. Response Generation:

The processed data is converted into a user-friendly response format.

The chatbot provides actionable information, including links to resources or escalation contacts.

Design of the Functions

1. filter_exceptions(data, date=None, type=None)

Purpose: Filters exceptions based on the provided date and/or type.

Input:

data: DataFrame containing exception data.

date: Date or date range to filter exceptions.

type: Exception type to filter.


Output: Filtered DataFrame with relevant exceptions.


def filter_exceptions(data, date=None, type=None):
    if date:
        data = data[data['date'] == date]
    if type:
        data = data[data['type'] == type]
    return data


2. get_resolution_resources(exception_id)

Purpose: Retrieves resources or documentation for resolving a specific exception.

Input:

exception_id: Unique identifier for the exception.


Output: A dictionary or string with links or steps for resolution.


def get_resolution_resources(exception_id):
    # Example logic: fetch resources based on ID
    return resolution_resources.get(exception_id, "No resources found.")


3. get_escalation_contact(exception_id)

Purpose: Provides escalation contact details for a given exception.

Input:

exception_id: Unique identifier for the exception.


Output: Contact information for escalation.


def get_escalation_contact(exception_id):
    # Example logic: fetch contact details
    return escalation_contacts.get(exception_id, "No contact found.")


4. parse_query(user_query)

Purpose: Parses the user query to identify intent and extract parameters.

Input: User query as a string.

Output: A dictionary containing intent and extracted parameters.


def parse_query(user_query):
    # Example logic: NLP processing
    return {
        "intent": "filter",  # Example: filter, resolve, escalate
        "params": {"date": "2024-12-19", "type": "Error"}
    }


5. generate_response(intent, params)

Purpose: Executes the appropriate function based on intent and formats the response.

Input:

intent: Identified intent from the query.

params: Parameters extracted from the query.


Output: A formatted string or JSON response for the user.


def generate_response(intent, params):
    if intent == "filter":
        result = filter_exceptions(data, **params)
    elif intent == "resolve":
        result = get_resolution_resources(params.get("exception_id"))
    elif intent == "escalate":
        result = get_escalation_contact(params.get("exception_id"))
    else:
        result = "Invalid query."
    return result



This modular design ensures flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of the chatbot while addressing the core problems efficiently.


Detailed Description of the Architecture

1. Architecture Overview

The chatbot is designed with a modular architecture that integrates various components for query processing, data handling, and response generation.

Frontend:

Provides a user-friendly interface for operations users to interact with the chatbot.

Can be implemented as a web app, mobile app, or integrated into communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams.


Backend:

Core logic of the chatbot resides here.

Handles query parsing, data processing, and response generation.


Data Layer:

Stores and manages the exception dashboard data, resources, and escalation contacts.

Data is ingested from the exception dashboard into pandas for processing.


Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine:

Parses user queries to identify intent and extract parameters.

Can use libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or pre-trained models like BERT for NLP tasks.


Integration Layer:

Interfaces with external tools, resources, and dashboards for real-time data updates or external API calls.

2. Data Flow

1. User Query Input:

User submits a query via the chatbot interface (e.g., "Show me exceptions for 2024-12-19").



2. Query Parsing:

The NLP engine processes the query to identify intent (e.g., filtering exceptions) and extracts parameters (e.g., date = "2024-12-19").



3. Data Processing:

Based on the intent, relevant data is fetched and processed using pandas.

Example: If filtering by date, a pandas query is run on the DataFrame to extract relevant rows.



4. Function Execution:

The appropriate function is invoked (e.g., filter_exceptions, get_resolution_resources).

External APIs or resource repositories may be queried for additional data.



5. Response Generation:

Processed data is formatted into a user-friendly response (e.g.,





Processed data is formatted into a user-friendly response (e.g., a tabular list of exceptions, a link to resources, or contact details).

The response is sent back to the user via the chatbot interface.

3. Tools and Resources Used

1. Programming Languages and Libraries:

Python: Primary language for backend logic and data processing.

Pandas: For handling and processing the exception dashboard data.

NLTK/spaCy/BERT: For natural language processing and intent recognition.



2. Data Sources:

Exception dashboard data: Exported in formats like CSV, Excel, or directly fetched via APIs.

Resolution resources: A repository or database containing guides and documentation for resolving exceptions.

Escalation contacts: A database or API containing contact details mapped to exceptions.



3. Frontend Tools:
