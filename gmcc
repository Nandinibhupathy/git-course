High-Level Problem Description

The problem is to determine the optimal stop-loss percentage for a stock trading strategy. Stop-loss is a risk management tool that limits an investor's loss by automatically selling an asset when its price drops to a predefined level. The goal is to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically learn the optimal stop-loss percentage from historical stock price data to maximize portfolio returns and minimize losses.

Summary of the Approach

The approach uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a popular RL algorithm, to learn the best stop-loss percentage based on stock price movements and market indicators. The problem is framed as a reinforcement learning environment, where:

1. The state consists of stock price, technical indicators (SMA and RSI), and current portfolio balance.


2. The action is the stop-loss percentage, represented as a continuous value between 1% and 10%.


3. The reward encourages the agent to maximize profits and penalizes stop-loss triggers that result in significant losses.



By interacting with the stock price data over multiple episodes, the agent learns to adjust the stop-loss percentage dynamically to minimize losses and optimize returns.

Design of Functions

1. StopLossEnv (Custom Environment Class)

This class implements the trading environment compatible with OpenAI Gym.

Purpose: Simulates stock price movements and evaluates the agent's stop-loss decisions.

Key Methods:

__init__: Initializes the environment with stock data, action space, and observation space.

reset: Resets the environment to the initial state (portfolio balance, price indicators, etc.).

step: Simulates one time step, calculates rewards based on stop-loss decisions, and updates the environment state.

_get_observation: Constructs the current state for the agent, including price, SMA, RSI, and portfolio balance.

render: Displays the current step's information for debugging or visualization.




2. load_stock_data

Purpose: Loads stock price data from a CSV file.

Inputs: Path to a CSV file containing stock data with columns: price, quantity, buy/sell, transaction_time.

Outputs: A Pandas DataFrame.



3. train_agent

Purpose: Trains the PPO agent on the custom environment.

Inputs:

env: The custom stop-loss environment.

timesteps: Number of training iterations (default: 50,000).


Outputs: A trained PPO model.



4. evaluate_stop_loss

Purpose: Evaluates the trained PPO agent's performance and calculates the average stop-loss percentage.

Inputs:

env: The custom stop-loss environment.

model: The trained PPO model.


Behavior:

Runs the environment using the trained model.

Logs actions (stop-loss percentages) and portfolio balance at each step.

Computes the average stop-loss percentage across the evaluation run.




5. main Execution

Purpose: Orchestrates the workflow:

1. Loads stock price data.


2. Initializes the environment.


3. Trains the PPO agent.


4. Evaluates the agent's performance.



Inputs: Path to the stock data CSV file.

Outputs: Prints the average optimal stop-loss percentage and step-wise details of the agent's decisions.

Summary of Design

1. Environment Design:

Action Space: Continuous range [1%, 10%] for stop-loss percentage.

State Space: Features include stock price, balance, SMA, and RSI.

Reward: Balances penalties for hitting stop-loss and rewards for price gains.



2. RL Algorithm:

Uses PPO from stable-baselines3, which is suitable for continuous action spaces and ensures stable learning.



3. Workflow:

Data Preparation: Load stock data and compute technical indicators.

Training: Train the agent using PPO on historical data.

Evaluation: Run the agent on the environment and calculate the learned stop-loss percentage.

Key Benefits of the Design

1. Dynamic Learning: The RL agent adapts to historical price patterns and learns the best stop-loss strategy.


2. Continuous Actions: Allows fine-grained stop-loss percentages instead of restricting to fixed intervals.


3. Market Awareness: Incorporates technical indicators (SMA, RSI) to improve decision-making.


4. Scalability: The design can handle different stocks and longer historical datasets.
