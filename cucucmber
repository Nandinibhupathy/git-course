The goal of this solution is to simplify the tasks of ops users.
Currently, they need to navigate through multiple dashboards and apply various filters to access different trade details and their exceptions.
This process can be quite challenging, especially in certain scenarios.


Sure! Here's a simple, conversational version of your speaking notes for this section:


---

Slide: Overview / Problem Statement

"Let me start with the core issue.

Ops teams are finding it hard to analyze exception data quickly and check trade statuses.
Sometimes, they don’t even have the right access, and even when they do, they have to go through huge, complex datasets just to find useful information.

This ends up taking a lot of time and slows down their entire workflow."


---

Slide: Challenges Faced by Ops Teams

"There are a few key challenges they face:

First, there’s no single place where they can find answers or troubleshooting steps. So, everyone handles things differently, and it’s not always consistent.

Second, even though trades have to be settled quickly, they don’t have instant solutions — which makes their job stressful.

Third, fixing errors takes time, and that delay can lead to trades settling late, which increases the risk.

And finally, new team members struggle to get up to speed because the systems are complicated and not very intuitive."

Slide: Proposed Solution – OpsEase

“So the idea behind OpsEase is to make exception handling a lot simpler for ops users.

Instead of jumping between dashboards and applying filters, users can now just ask questions in plain language.

It connects to our Operational Data Store, pulls the relevant data, and gives quick, clear answers — whether that’s exception details, trade status, or even escalation contacts.

We’ve built it in Python using pandas, so it handles large datasets efficiently and cuts down a lot of manual effort."


---

Slide: Sample Use Cases

"Here’s what OpsEase can help with:

Replay a trade by just entering its ID

Replay failed trades for a specific market, date, and time

Check trade status — whether it’s settled or failed

Get exception details for any trade

Find resolution resources and escalation points

And even summarize exception counts over a given time period


All of this through simple, natural language inputs — making the whole process faster and more user-friendly."

Certainly! Here are simple, clear, and conversational speaking notes for your Future Enhancements slide:


---

Slide: Future Enhancements

"Looking ahead, we have a few exciting enhancements planned for OpsEase that will take its capabilities even further."


---

1. Automated Error Detection & Resolution

"First, we’re working on letting the bot analyze pasted error logs to detect patterns automatically.

Once it identifies the issue, it will suggest guided resolution steps.
And if the issue needs access or escalation — like raising a ticket — the bot will generate the ARM (Access Request Management) ticket automatically.

This means less manual work and faster issue resolution."


---

2. Proactive Issue Detection & Escalation

"Next, the bot will start spotting repeated issues across different users.

If it detects a trend that points to a wider system problem, it will immediately notify the right teams — like MAPS or tech support — through email.

This helps teams step in early and avoid bigger outages."


---

3. Dynamic Knowledge Enrichment

"And finally, as users solve new types of issues, the bot will learn from those resolutions.

It will automatically update its knowledge base, which means over time it becomes smarter and more independent.

This learning loop will help it handle a wider variety of problems with less human intervention."


---

"All of these enhancements aim to make OpsEase not just a support tool — but a proactive, intelligent partner for ops teams."

Here are clean, simple, and conversational speaking notes for your "Benefits to the Business & Value Provided" slide:


---

Slide: Business Benefits & Value

"Let’s now talk about the value OpsEase brings to the business."


---

1. Improved Efficiency

"First, it saves a lot of time.
Ops users no longer need to manually filter through large datasets.
With just one query, they get all the information they need — exceptions, resolution steps, and escalation contacts — all in one go."


---

2. Enhanced User Experience

"Interacting with the system becomes much easier.
Instead of needing deep system knowledge, users can just type natural language queries.
This simplifies the whole process and makes it more accessible for everyone."


---

3. Scalability

"OpsEase is designed to scale.
Its modular structure means we can easily plug in new data sources or features as the business grows — no rework needed."


---

4. Reduced Errors

"Automation helps reduce human mistakes that usually happen during manual data lookups or filtering, which improves accuracy."


---

5. Cost Savings

"By reducing manual effort, OpsEase also helps cut down on operational overhead, which can translate into real cost savings over time."


---

6. Standardized Support

"And finally, it brings consistency.
Everyone gets the same accurate information and resolution steps, which improves collaboration and reduces confusion."


---

"Together, these benefits make OpsEase a valuable tool — not just for ops teams, but for the business as a whole."
