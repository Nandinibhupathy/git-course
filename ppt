Description of the Problem:

OpsEase is designed to streamline the process of accessing and managing exception data for operations users. By integrating with the Operational Data Store (ODS), the bot allows users to quickly query and retrieve information related to exceptions, including filtering by date and type. Additionally, it provides resources to help resolve exceptions and offers guidance on escalation contacts.

Built using Python and leveraging the power of pandas for data processing, OpsEase Bot simplifies the interaction with complex datasets, making it easier for operations teams to address and resolve issues efficiently. This tool enhances user experience by providing a more intuitive and responsive way to interact with exception data, reducing the time and effort required for manual analysis.
