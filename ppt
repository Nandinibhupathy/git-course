Architecture Description

1. Query Interpretation
The chatbot receives user input and uses regular expressions (regex) to identify the intent—such as filtering by date, exception type, or requesting resources/escalation. Key details like date ranges and keywords are extracted for further processing.


2. Data Interaction
Using pandas, the bot interacts with structured exception data from the Operational Data Store (ODS), typically in CSV format. It applies relevant filters based on the parsed query to retrieve targeted results.


3. Task-Specific Data Processing

Filtering by Date/Type: Filters data to match user-defined criteria.

Resolution Assistance: Maps exceptions to known resolution resources.

Escalation Handling: Identifies escalation contacts or next steps based on exception severity or type.



4. Response Generation
The bot formats and delivers results—whether it’s a list of exceptions, resolution steps, or escalation info—into a clear, user-friendly response.



This architecture automates and simplifies exception data access for operations users, reducing manual effort and improving response times.

Here’s a comprehensive and refined architecture description for the OpsEase bot, integrating all the key points you've provided:


---

OpsEase Bot – Architecture Description

The OpsEase bot is architected to streamline exception data management for operations teams by combining intelligent query handling, efficient data processing, and context-aware response generation.

1. Query Processing & Interpretation
The bot receives user input via a conversational interface and processes it using regular expressions (regex) to determine the intent—such as filtering by date, exception type, or requesting resolution or escalation help. It extracts key parameters like date ranges, exception types, and keywords to guide the data query.


2. Data Handling & Filtering
Leveraging pandas, the bot interacts with structured data from the Operational Data Store (ODS), typically in CSV format. It applies filters based on user inputs to retrieve only the relevant exception records—minimizing manual search effort.


3. Task-Specific Logic Modules

Date/Type Filtering: Retrieves exception records that match specific criteria.

Resolution Resource Mapping: Identifies and presents step-by-step guides or links relevant to the exception.

Escalation Contact Identification: Determines the appropriate escalation contact or action based on exception severity or type.



4. Response Generation
Based on the processed data and task outcome, the bot generates a concise, readable response. This may include filtered exception lists, recommended actions, or escalation contact details—presented directly in the chat interface.


5. User Experience & Efficiency
This architecture ensures a user-friendly experience by simplifying complex data queries into natural language interactions. It reduces operational delays by automating exception resolution and supporting proactive issue management.

Future Enhancements

1. Automated Error Detection & Resolution
The bot will analyze pasted error logs, identify issues using predefined patterns, and provide step-by-step resolution guidance. For unresolved errors, it will auto-generate ARM (Action Request Management) tickets—eliminating manual effort and accelerating issue resolution.


2. Proactive Issue Detection & Escalation
By identifying repeated issues across users, the bot will flag potential system-wide problems and notify relevant teams (e.g., MAPS, tech support) automatically—enabling faster intervention and minimizing operational impact.


3. Dynamic Knowledge Enrichment
When users provide resolutions not in the current knowledge base, the bot will learn and update itself automatically—continuously evolving to handle a broader range of issues independently.
