High-Level Problem Description

The problem is to determine the optimal stop-loss percentage for stock trading using Deep Q-Learning (DQN), a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. A stop-loss is a pre-set price level at which a trader exits a trade to prevent further losses.

The goal is to dynamically learn the best stop-loss percentage using historical stock data, maximizing profits while minimizing risks. By leveraging DQN, the agent learns to make optimal decisions based on price trends and technical indicators, such as Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI).

Summary of the Approach

1. Problem Framing as RL:

The task is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).

State: Includes stock price, SMA, RSI, portfolio balance, and time-related features.

Action: Discrete choices for stop-loss percentage (e.g., 1%, 2%, ..., 10%).

Reward: Positive reward for profit or avoiding unnecessary stop-loss hits; negative reward for losses or frequent stop-loss triggers.



2. Algorithm:

Deep Q-Learning (DQN) is used to approximate the optimal Q-value function.

The agent selects stop-loss percentages based on Q-values for given states.

A neural network maps states to Q-values and is trained using experience replay and the Bellman equation.



3. Workflow:

Historical stock data is loaded and preprocessed.

A custom environment (StopLossEnv) is created to simulate stock trading and evaluate stop-loss decisions.

The DQN agent is trained by interacting with the environment over multiple episodes.

After training, the learned policy is evaluated to compute the average optimal stop-loss percentage.

Design of Functions

1. Custom Environment (StopLossEnv)

Simulates the stock trading process, allowing the agent to learn stop-loss strategies.

Purpose: Provide states, process actions, and calculate rewards for each step.

Key Methods:

__init__: Initializes the environment with stock data, action space, and observation space.

reset: Resets the environment to the starting state.

step: Processes the chosen action, calculates rewards, and transitions to the next state.

_get_observation: Constructs the current state as a feature vector.

render: Optionally prints step-by-step information for debugging or visualization.




2. Data Preprocessing (load_stock_data)

Loads and preprocesses historical stock data.

Inputs: CSV file containing stock prices and transactions.

Outputs: DataFrame with added SMA and RSI columns.



3. Q-Network Architecture (build_q_network)

Defines the deep neural network used to approximate the Q-value function.

Inputs: State vector as input features.

Outputs: Q-values for each action (stop-loss percentage).



4. Replay Buffer

Stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next state, done flag) for experience replay.

Purpose: Stabilizes learning by breaking correlation between consecutive experiences.

Methods:

add: Adds new experiences to the buffer.

sample: Samples random batches for training.




5. Training Loop (train_dqn)

Trains the DQN agent by interacting with the environment.

Steps:

1. Reset the environment at the start of each episode.


2. Use the Q-network to select an action (exploration vs. exploitation).


3. Execute the action in the environment and observe the reward and next state.


4. Store the experience in the replay buffer.


5. Update the Q-network using mini-batch gradient descent.



Inputs: Environment, Q-network, replay buffer, hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, gamma).

Outputs: Trained Q-network.



6. Evaluation (evaluate_dqn)

Evaluates the trained DQN agent's policy on the environment.

Steps:

1. Reset the environment.


2. Run the agent using the learned policy (deterministic action selection).


3. Log the stop-loss percentages and final portfolio balance.



Outputs: Average optimal stop-loss percentage and trading performance.



7. Main Function

Orchestrates the entire workflow:

1. Load stock data and preprocess it.


2. Initialize the environment and DQN agent.


3. Train the agent using the environment.


4. Evaluate the agent's learned policy.



Inputs: Path to stock data CSV file.

Outputs: Prints the optimal stop-loss percentage and performance metrics.

Key Components of the DQN Algorithm

1. State Representation:
The state vector includes:

Current stock price.

Portfolio balance.

SMA (normalized relative to price).

RSI (normalized between 0 and 1).

Time step (optional for temporal context).



2. Action Space:

Discrete actions corresponding to stop-loss percentages (e.g., [1%, 2%, ..., 10%]).



3. Reward Function:

Positive reward for avoiding losses or realizing gains.

Negative reward for frequent stop-loss hits or significant losses.



4. Neural Network:

A fully connected feedforward network maps states to Q-values for each action.

Loss is minimized using the Huber loss or mean squared error (MSE) between predicted and target Q-values.



5. Experience Replay:

Random sampling from the replay buffer stabilizes training by reducing correlations in the data.

Workflow Summary

1. Environment Initialization:
Simulates stock trading with stop-loss decisions and calculates rewards based on portfolio performance.


2. Training:
The agent interacts with the environment, explores various stop-loss percentages, and updates its Q-network using experience replay.


3. Evaluation:
The trained policy is tested to compute the average stop-loss percentage and overall portfolio performance.

Expected Output

After training and evaluation, the system provides:

1. Optimal Stop-Loss Percentage: The average stop-loss percentage learned by the agent.


2. Performance Metrics: Final portfolio balance and details of the agent's decisions during evaluation.
